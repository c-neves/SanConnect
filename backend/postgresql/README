# Running
 docker run -P sanconnect
# Connecting to the docker database via terminal

# First you check which port has been mapped to the postgresql port (5432):
docker ps

# Then you use the client installed on your machine to connect (test password - 'sanconnect2')(:
psql -h localhost -p 32768 -d sanconnect -U sanconnect --password
# Note: In this example, the port 5432 has been mapped to 32768, and we're accessing from the same machine that is executing the container.
